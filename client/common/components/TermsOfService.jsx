								<b>5. Complaints Procedure</b>

								<p>In the event a User wishes to complain about any aspect of this Website, the User should put his complaint in writing. In making such a complaint, the User should set out the facts supporting the complaint and the conclusion he has drawn from those facts. In other words, state what actually has happened and why the User feels that such events warrant a complaint. The User should also include copies of all relevant documents and furnish full personal particulars, including name, address, NRIC number, as well as phone and fax number and e-mail address if the User has these. User's complaint should be addressed to:</p>
								<p>AsiaFS Ltd 4 Robinson Road, #04-01, The House of Eden Singapore 048543</p>
								<p>AFS will normally acknowledge receipt of the User's complaint within three (3) working days of receiving it and AFS aims to provide a full response within the period stated in the acknowledgement. However, where AFS needs to ask for further information, it may take longer to respond to the User's complaint. If, on the other hand, AFS reasonably anticipates providing a quick full response, AFS may not send a separate initial acknowledgement. If AFS is unable to help, AFS will provide the User with an explanation. AFS shall help the User complainant to resolve any complaints but AFS reserves the rights in its sole discretion to take any action that is appropriate and allowed under Singapore law.</p>
								<p>AFS may not be able to help User if User's complaint is subject to litigation or is pending before the courts.</p>
								<p>AFS will also not investigate any complaint which is beyond the scope of this Agreement, including but not limited to any complaint concerning matters that do not relate to Users, the terms of usage of this Website, any other matter not touched upon by these terms and conditions or any matter which is properly disposed of by any regulatory or dispute resolution body. In particular, this includes the provision of investment advice, terms of takeover offers, and any complaint the User may have about the commercial management of a quoted company. If AFS believes that the complaint should be handled by another regulatory or dispute resolution body, AFS will send it to the appropriate body and let the User know that AFS is doing so.</p>
								<p>If AFS considers that a complaint made by a User is vexatious or frivolous, AFS will advise that User complainant that no action will be taken. In addition that User shall bear all reasonable incidental expenses incurred by AFS in the investigation of such complaint.</p>
								<b>6. Copyright Complaints</b>

								<p>If any User believes that his copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on this Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, the User shall provide AFS the following information by way of written notice :</p>
								<p>User's physical signature or that of the person authorised to act on the User's behalf.</p>
								<p>a description of the copyrighted work that User claims has been infringed and a description of the infringing activity.</p>
								<p>identification of the location where the original or an authorised copy of the copyrighted work exists, for example the URL (i.e., web page address) where it is posted or the name of the book in which it has been published.</p>
								<p>identification of the URL or other specific location on this Website where the material that User claims is infringing is located, including enough information to allow AFS to locate the material.</p>
								<p>User's full name, address, telephone number, and email address.</p>
								<p>a statement by the User that he has a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorised by him, his agent, or the law.</p>
								<p>a statutory declaration made by the User that the above information in User's written notice is accurate and that User is the copyright owner or authorised to act on the copyright owner's behalf.</p>
								<p>AFS will respond to the User according to its legal obligations under the laws of Singapore. AFS EXPECTS ALL USERS TO COMPLY WITH ALL RELEVANT LAWS, AS WELL AS THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND UPON RECEIVING REASONABLE NOTIFICATION, WILL TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW AND THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE OBSERVED AND COMPLIED WITH INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE ON THIS WEBSITE AT AFS'S SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
								<b>7. General</b>

								<p>Severability</p>
								<p>If any provision in this Agreement is found or held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the meaning of such provision shall be construed to the fullest extent allowed by law so as to render the provision valid and enforceable, and if no such construction is possible, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement and all provisions not affected by such invalidity or unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect and the parties to this Agreement shall use their best efforts to negotiate, in good faith, a substitute, valid and enforceable provision or agreement which achieves to the greatest extent possible the economic legal and commercial objectives of the invalid or unenforceable provision.</p>
								<p>Agency</p>
								<p>This Agreement creates no agency, partnership, joint venture or employment and neither User, his agents, the Information Provider nor its agents have any authority to bind AFS in any respect whatsoever.</p>
